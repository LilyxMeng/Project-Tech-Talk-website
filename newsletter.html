                        particularly passionate about the field. Look our for our first module on the basics of AI! We
                        hope that through this website, we can create an accessible platform to learn about the

                        on a Digital Literacy webinar which turned out to be a success! Thank you to everyone who
                        participated and we hope you found it valuable. We also worked with <a class="newsletter-link"
                            href="">Girls in Aerospace</a> to create a post on <a class="newsletter-link"

                        coming in, we weren't very confident in our knowledge of spacecraft, but we were able to learn
                        so much through our research and the GIA team. We hope that by reading our post on our
                        Instagram, you are able to learn just as much as we did.
