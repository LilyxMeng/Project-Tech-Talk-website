                        resources that could <strong><em>strengthen your engineering and computer science mind!</em>

                        particularly passionate about the field. Look our for our first module on the basics of AI! We
                        hope that through this website, we can create an accessible platform to learn about the
                        <strong><em>engineering and computer science field :)</em></strong>

                    <p class="newsletter-content-text">We worked with Project XXI on a Digital Literacy webinar which
                        turned out to be a success! Thank you to everyone who participated and we hope you found it
                        valuable. We also worked with Girls in Aerospace to create a post on <a class="newsletter-link"
                            href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CM7IUJODBlA/" target="_blank">SpaceX's Merlin Engines</a>!
                        Truthfully, coming in, we weren't very confident in our knowledge of spacecraft, but we were
                        able to learn so much through our research and the GIA team. We hope that by reading our post on
                        our Instagram, you are able to learn just as much as we did.
                    </p>
                    <p class="newsletter-content-text">Next month, we expect to continue collaborating with
                        organizations from all around the world to expand our knowledge on techy subjects and
                        communicate them to you!</p>
